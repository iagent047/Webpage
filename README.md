Brief:
The task was to replicate a flask dashboard website frontend. I have managed build it as close as possible using HTML5 with Bootstrap 3 & google charts utiliztion. The web site contains the following sections:
A top navbar with multiple options including a search box.
A side navigation bar with multiple options.
four Cards to display real time values fetched from external sources.
Three maps to plot data over time.
Two tables to display table data of specific records as per the required/defined logic.
